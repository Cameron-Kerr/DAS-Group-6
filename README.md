# IMDB Movie Rating Prediction-Group 6
This is a repository of material used for Project 2 for Group 6 of the Data Analysis Skills course at the University of Glasgow.

This project aims to analyze the IMDB dataset using logistic regression to determine which factors influence whether a movie receives a rating higher than 7.
By understanding these influences, producers can make decisions to improve the success of future films. 
In addition, this analysis provides insights into audience preferences and industry trends, helping to predict the likelihood of a film receiving a high rating.
